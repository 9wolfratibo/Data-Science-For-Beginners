The movie is set in the 1950s and 1960s, a period when the caste system was prevalent and oppressive in rural Maharashtra. Ashok belongs to a lower caste called Dhor or Kakkayya, which is considered outside the Hindu ritual ranking system. He faces discrimination and violence from the upper castes, who treat him as an untouchable and an inferior. He also witnesses the plight of other lower caste people, especially women, who are exploited and abused by the dominant castes.
 
However, Ashok also finds kindness and compassion from some people who help him along his journey. One of them is Radhakka, a widowed woman with four children who takes him under her wing and treats him as her own son. She teaches him the values of courage, honesty, dignity and self-respect. She also exposes him to the realities of poverty, hunger, illiteracy and social injustice that afflict the rural masses. She inspires him to pursue his education and his dreams despite the odds.
